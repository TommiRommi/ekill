# ekill
a easy and fast linux command line tool for killing processes.

this bash script drastically simplifies the processes of killing processes to a point where typing there name is enought.
It also has the feature to create a list of processes that can all be killed simutaneously, and the abilty to stop the user from killing root processes.
